## Profiles
Profiles are used to quickly configure your VSCode IDE for a given type of development and includes settings and extensions. We currently have 2 profiles for you:
- python
- Raspberry Pi Pico

To use: 
1. Download the profile in the profile directory to your local machine.
2. In VSCode click on the setting icon in the bottom left corner
3. Select `Profile > Profiles > New Profile > Import Profile...`
4. Choose the profile you just downloaded and then click on `Create Profile`
